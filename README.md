# About Wahlzeit

Wahlzeit is an open source web application that lets users upload photos and rate photos of other users on a 1..10 scale. Users get to present their best photos and learn what other users thought of theirs.

Wahlzeit is used to teach agile methods and open source software development at the Professorship of Open Source Software at the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg.
